# Example Data Sets
> The JSON files in this directory are to be used from certain API endpoints. Because we'd rather not share the API data, you can create your own if you wish to host it for yourself.
- Rename the folder from `data.example` to `data` and remove `.example` from all `.json` files.
- Proceed into editing them however you want.
