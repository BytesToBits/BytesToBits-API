The BytesToBits API is a free, open-source API available to everyone.  
In order to use the API, you need to use a key. To obtain one, [create an account](/login)! API keys are unique, and they should not be shared with others.  
API keys are also used to prevent API spams. That's why there is a **50 requests/minute** limit set to all accounts. Surpassing this limit will result in getting rate-limited, which is a temporary block from using the API. The more frequent the rate-limit is triggered, the longer the timeouts will be, so be aware.
Check out [How to not get rate-limited](/#rate-limits) to prevent it.
